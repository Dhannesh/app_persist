The file system is a great option if you have unstructured data, maybe data in the form of long form text and you want to preserve this data across app launches. The file system is also a great option if you want to download and store data that you've accessed from the Internet and you want to be able to access this data offline later on sometime. Another reason to potentially use files to store data is that you want to be able to share the file with other users using some kind of sharing services, maybe e-mail or some kind of messenger service. With Flutter, storing files on your local device is very straightforward. Flutter apps can use libraries to access, read, and write data stored on your device's disk. Your mobile device has a file system, and there are certain locations in that file system that your app can write to.
